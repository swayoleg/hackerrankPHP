### File Descriptions

- **solution.php**: The file you can copy-paste into the HackerRank editor and run the code.
- **info.txt**: Information about what you need to learn to solve the task.
- **test.php**: The code with data to test and compare if it works correctly. (In the future, this might be done with PHPUnit).
- **testcases/**: Contains input and expected output files for tests. You will find there %number_of_case%-input.txt and %number_of_case%-output.txt files. The first one is the input data for the test.php file and the second one is the expected output.

To run test navigate to folder and run php test.php
Example:
```bash
cd 3MonthPreparationKit/Week13/1_FindTheRunningMedian
php test.php
```

### Also there is a [1WeekPreparationKit](1WeekPreparationKit) which is just a sample, some of task are in [3MonthPreparationKit](3MonthPreparationKit)
### At [OtherTasks](OtherTasks) you can find interesting tasks from different interviews and coding challenges.
