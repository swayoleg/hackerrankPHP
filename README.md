### File Descriptions

- **solution.php**: The file you can copy-paste into the HackerRank editor and run the code.
- **info.txt**: Information about what you need to learn to solve the task.
- **test.php**: The code with data to test and compare if it works correctly. (In the future, this might be done with PHPUnit).
- **testcases/**: Contains input and expected output files for tests. You will find there %number_of_case%-input.txt and %number_of_case%-output.txt files. The first one is the input data for the test.php file and the second one is the expected output.
