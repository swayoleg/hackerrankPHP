Celebrity lookup

Problem Setup:

You have a group of people.
Some people may know others within the group.
A celebrity is someone who knows no one but is known by everyone.
You need to find a selebrity and return its index otherwise returl null;
You dont have full matrix - instead you can ask one person if he knows another person with 'knows' method

Constraints:
You must minimize the number of calls to knows(a, b).

For example -

$arrayLength = 5;
$knownMap[0] = [1,2,3,4];  // 0 knows 1, 2, 3, 4
$knownMap[1] = [0,2,3,4]; // 1 knows 0, 2, 3, 4
$knownMap[2] = [3];  // 2 knows 3
$knownMap[3] = []; // 3 knows no one
$knownMap[4] = [3, 1]; // 4 knows 3, 1
// celebrity is 3 - he doesnt know anyone and everyone knows him
so return 3 in this case
