Problem Description:
Given a street with houses, each containing a certain amount of money, represented by an array.
The goal is to maximize the amount of money you can rob, with the constraint that you cannot rob two adjacent houses(near each other).

Example:
For the array [1, 2, 3, 1], the optimal solution is to rob houses 1 and 3, yielding a total of 4.
For the array [5, 2, 4, 6], the optimal solution is to rob houses 1 and 4, yielding a total of 11.
